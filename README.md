# Summer-Researcch-Internship
The code is a simulation of new cahce algorithm.
It has been written in c++, using the following libraries
1) vector
An inbuilt implementation of dynamically sizing arrays.

2) list
Implementation of doubly linked list data structure. 

3) iostream
Input output functions of c++

4) cmath
Typically used for inbuilt math function of c++.

To compile the code, we can write "g++ -o a <filename.cpp>" in a linux/windows terminal.
To execute the compiled file we have to write "./a"

The program demands two inputs.
1) Number of simulations
    Number of simulations is the number of time a pattern would get repeated.
2) Size of the Working_Set
    The size of the pattern that has to be repeatedly accessed.

Important variables:
 PSEL => Policy Selector 
 Epsilon => Epsilon parameter for the BIP policy.
